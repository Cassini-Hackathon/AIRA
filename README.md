# 🚑 AIRA (Advanced Integrated Response & Aid Assistant)

## Overview

**AIRA** is an AI-powered, satellite-enhanced emergency response system designed to revolutionize the way critical medical help is requested, dispatched, and managed.  
When every second counts, AIRA ensures rapid coordination between users, healthcare providers, and emergency vehicles—both manned and unmanned—through intelligent automation and satellite connectivity.

## Core Features

###  Smart Emergency Request Initiation
Users can trigger a distress signal in two intuitive ways:
- Traditional voice call to emergency services (e.g. 118)
- AI-assisted reporting: Describe the situation using voice notes, text, or photos.

**Technologies used:**
- Speech-to-text: Transcription powered by [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- Image captioning: Situation inferred via [BLIP (Bootstrapping Language Image Pretraining)](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base)

---

### Autonomous Dispatch Algorithm
AIRA+ intelligently assesses the emergency type and orchestrates the most effective response by:
- Analyzing resource availability
- Calculating real-time proximity via satellite geolocalization
- Initiating autonomous dispatch of appropriate assets (ambulances, helicopters, or drones equipped with first aid kits, AEDs, and life-saving medications)

---

### Satellite-Enhanced Routing
Our routing engine dynamically optimizes both aerial and ground paths, considering:
- Real-time weather conditions
- Terrain morphology and accessibility
- Airspace and road traffic data

---

### Hospital Control Panel
Every healthcare facility is equipped with a admin dashboard that includes:
- Real-time asset tracking map (vehicles, drones, etc.)
- Emergency history with patient and medical details
- Inventory of operational assets with data on:
  - Battery/fuel levels
  - Maintenance logs
  - Availability status

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React  
- **Mobile Stack:** Capacitor (cross-platform compatibility)  
- **Backend:** Python, Firebase (Authentication + Realtime DB), FastAPI  
- **AI/ML Models:**
  - [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for speech-to-text  
  - [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) for image-to-text

---

## Use of Space Technologies

- **Copernicus CDS** for weather data  
- **Satellite GNSS** for accurate user geolocation and routing

---

## Target

AIRA aims to **shorten emergency response time**, especially in **remote, rural, or disaster-affected areas**, where infrastructure is scarce or overwhelmed.  
With AI-driven triage and satellite-based logistics, we empower emergency responders to act **smarter**, **faster**, and more **efficiently**, ultimately **saving more lives**.
